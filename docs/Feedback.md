in skills I would drop the "studying" part of studying python, it just seems a little unsure and you honsetly are probably more proficient than alot of people who have "python" on their resume

You specify what kind of mathematics in "skills"

For the link to your email you could make the button just say "email" instead of your actual address its totally a style choice but I think it would be cool
